# CNN Cancer Detection Project

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. The project was developed as part of Week 3 coursework and uses deep learning techniques to classify medical images as either malignant or normal.

## Problem Description

The primary objective is to create an algorithm capable of identifying metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans with high accuracy. Specifically, the model needs to:

- Classify **57,458 test images** as either **malignant** or **normal**
- Detect if an image contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue in the center 32Ã—32px region
- Achieve high classification accuracy for medical diagnostic purposes

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **PatchCamelyon (PCam)** benchmark dataset provided through Kaggle's Histopathologic Cancer Detection competition:

- **Training Dataset**: 220,025 images with known labels (malignant/normal)
- **Test Dataset**: 57,458 images for evaluation
- **Image Format**: 96Ã—96Ã—3 (RGB images)
- **Dataset Balance**: ~40% malignant cases, ~60% normal cases
- **Data Quality**: No duplicates (unlike original PCam dataset)

### Key Dataset Features
- âœ… Balanced dataset distribution
- âœ… Binary classification labels (0=normal, 1=malignant)
- âœ… No duplicate images in training or test sets
- âœ… Consistent image dimensions (96Ã—96Ã—3)
